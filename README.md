# System_Identification_SVD

# This is system identification using SVD.
# There are some assumptions about the system:
# 1. The system is discrete.
# 2. Assuming initial conditions are all zeros.
# 3. Assuming D = 0.
# 4. Assuming the dimension of states are unknown, which I assume to be the rank of Hankel Matrix.
# 5. Dimension of Hankel matrix should be set mannually.
